“The following relate to the changes of vowels as found in the evolution to the written medieval languages of Iberia, Gallia and Italia (Anglo-Norman, Old Spanish, etc.). The Latin of Africa, Sardinia and the easternmost parts of the Empire exhibited different mergers.”

{e,i} → j / C_V when unstressed

{e,ai} → ɛ

{i,eː,oi} → e

iː → i

o → ɔ

{u,oː} → o

uː → u

aː → a

m → n / _# “(in certain common monosyllabic words, as well as some common compounds of them)”

m → ∅ / _#

h → ∅

w → β

ɛ ɔ → e o / when unstressed

j → ʝ / #_V

j → ʝː / V_V

“In contrast, Romanian exhibits u, uː → u (and ultimately also ɔ, oː → o); and Sardinian and African Latin underwent a straight merger of the vowels by length without considering quality (e, eː → e; i, iː → i; u, uː → u; etc.)”
